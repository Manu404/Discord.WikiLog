# Politilog
A tool based on discord webhook to publish media wiki change event to discord triggereg by cronjob to monitor wiki

Future plan to make it usable by anyone. 

It can be used for now by any mediawiki as the webhook url and wiki url are given as parameter, but the UI is in french, a localization effort would be required to at least support english.

Maybe in the future, stay tuned !
