# Politilog
A tool based on discord webhook to publish message related to MediaWiki changes to discord channels. Actually triggereg by cronjob to monitor wiki the wiki.

Maybe future plan to make it usable by anyone. 

It can be used for now by any mediawiki as the webhook url and wiki url are given as parameter, but the UI is in french and some part of the link URLS like for page and user use french words, a localization effort would be required to at least support english.

Maybe in the future, stay tuned !
